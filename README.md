# backbonetodo
To do list to practice backbone.js

This is mostly just the code from the http://todomvc.com/ example for backbone.js.

I was supposed to try to figure out which framework a sample codebase was an exercise for a JavaScript design patterns course on Udacity. https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989

Then I found this book which goes over making the todo list and some other stuff using backbone. http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/#backbones-sync-api

But it's not a short one.  Currently working on a library for the Conservatory of Flowers using backbone and mongo too off of an example from the book.

Still to do with the todo list:

Have some buttons for adding the todos of a given shift:
JSON.stringify(app.Todos.toJSON())
can give me a nice string of json of whatever todos I've typed in to make lists for the separate shifts and then hard code em in.
